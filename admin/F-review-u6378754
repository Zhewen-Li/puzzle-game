Review Comments:

1. Improve names of board and viewer variables to better describe them
2. Pretty good documentation though a bit more commenting would be good
3. Good decomposition of code into smaller methods, appropriate method names
4. Good use of changing/returning values relative to the board size, e.g. use of SQUARE_SIZE rather than distinct number
