I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method startGame() in class Board() lines 580-596
* The method startGame() in class Board() lines 644-708
* Class PieceJFX

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The method startGame() lines 580-596 uses code based from Zhewen's implementation of the hint button.
* Some code from getImagePiece method in class PieceJFX was from Saffron's viewer code implementation of piece images
* Use of methods in startGame() such as setScaleX help on implementation is from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/Node.html
