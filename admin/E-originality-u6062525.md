I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage E of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the
following documented exceptions:

* The suggestion to move test methods into a separate .java file came from our tutor, Yaya Lu
* Randomly picking a peg to use from an array of pegs was taken almost directly from lecture code
